The user asks the Assistant a question\n2. The Assistant sends the (recognized) text to the third-party Action\n3. In the third-party Action architecture, a machine model trained by DialogFlow determines the user's intent\n4. To further respond, filtered parameters are passed to Fulfillment for logic processing or data retrieval\n5. Fulfillment returns the corresponding Intent response to the Assistant\n6. The Assistant receives the response and presents it to the user.`
